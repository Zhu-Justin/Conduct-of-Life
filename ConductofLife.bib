	abstract = {"In the age that announces the death of metaphysics, that is alive to the existence of the 'other', and defends democratic citizenship against the privilege of masters, what future can there be for a liberal arts education grounded in the pursuit of first principles? This book explores the tradition of first principles within liberal arts education, retracing the themes of discipline and freedom within its history from antiquity to RM Hutchins. It then offers a challenge to the logic of that tradition as it appears within metaphysical, natural and social relations, arguing that this ancient logic is no longer fit for purpose. Philosophy and Modern Liberal Arts argues for a modern version of liberal arts education, exploring first principles within the divine comedy of a modern educational logic, reforming the three philosophies of metaphysics, nature and ethics upon which liberal arts education is based. At a time when there is something of a resurgence of liberal arts education in Europe, and a crisis around liberal arts education in the USA, this book offers a profound transatlantic philosophical and educational challenge to its students and practitioners"--},
